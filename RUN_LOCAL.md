# 🏃 How to Run Locally

## ✅ Simple Command:

```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\death-tracker
npm run dev:server
```

**This will:**
1. Build the frontend
2. Start the Express server with Puppeteer
3. Open at: http://localhost:3000

---

## 🎯 What You'll See:

**Terminal:**
```
🚀 Server running on port 3000
📡 API: http://localhost:3000/api/deaths
🌐 Frontend: http://localhost:3000
```

**Browser:** http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Deaths loading
- ✅ Character data
- ✅ All features working

---

## ⚠️ Known Local Issues:

Puppeteer on Windows can be problematic:
- Detached frame errors
- Memory issues
- Timeouts

**If it doesn't work locally:**
- ❌ Don't worry! 
- ✅ It WILL work on Render (Linux is better for Puppeteer)
- ✅ Just deploy to Render

---

## 🚀 Deploy to Render:

**Render handles everything better than local Windows!**

1. Go to: https://render.com
2. Import: `sowber/rubinot-death-tracker`
3. Deploy!

**Render = Linux = Puppeteer works perfectly!** ✅
